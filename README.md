# Laptop Catalog Request
**Project Overview**

This project automates the process of requesting laptops within an organization using ServiceNow’s Service Catalog.
The system replaces the manual request process with a dynamic, user-friendly catalog item that ensures accurate data collection, faster approvals, and improved user experience.

**Key Features**

- Dynamic form with conditional field visibility (e.g., “Accessories Details” appears only when accessories are selected).
- “Reset Form” functionality to clear inputs instantly.
- Update Set configuration for seamless deployment across instances.
- Real-time validation and structured request tracking.
- Scalable architecture that can be extended for other IT service requests.

**Project Deliverables**

- Complete project documentation (Ideation, Design, Planning, Requirement Analysis, and Performance Testing).
- Working implementation on the ServiceNow platform.
- Demo video showcasing the catalog item creation, configuration, and testing process.
